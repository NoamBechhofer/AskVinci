# AskVinci
In the config file, replace the question mark with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Then run the AskVinci.py script.

In your browser, add a search engine which queries http://localhost:60703/%s (with %s in place of a query)

You can now query openai directly from your browser's search bar.
